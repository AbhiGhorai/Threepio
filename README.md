Auto Json is code generator that generates fast JSON mapping for your java classes. It uses org.json library from Android SDK to encode and decode JSON data from class members. It does not use reflection but simple code generation using annotation processing so it is as fast.

### [Auto Parcel](https://github.com/abdullah-chhatra/Threepio/wiki/Auto-Parcel)
Code generator that generates `android.os.Parcelable` implementation for a given java class. It does not use reflection but simple code generation using annotation processing so it is as fast.

### [Places View](https://github.com/abdullah-chhatra/Threepio/wiki/Auto-complete-Places-View)
